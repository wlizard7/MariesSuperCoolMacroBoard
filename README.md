Hello, this is my submission for my hackpad! 

## Features 

# PCB 

## Challenges
This was my first ever hardware project, although I do use Fusion360. I came into this with no idea of what KiCad was or hardly any knowledge about hardware however I somehow 
figured things out AKA I watched a bunch of YouTube tutorials. Even with CAD experience, making the case was trickier than I thought it'd be, and I ended up having to remake both the PCB and case a few times. 

## Specifications

BOM : 

1x Seeed XIAO RP2040
9x 1N4148 Diodes
1x 0.91 inch OLED display 
1x EC11 Rotary encoder
8x MX-Style switches
8x Blank DSA keycaps
4x SK6812 MINI-E LEDs
6x M3x16mm screws
6x M3x5mx4mm heatset inserts

## Notes
This was super fun! Three all nighters later, my project is done. I learned a lot through this process, and this has given me a whole lot of ideas of what project to do next.
