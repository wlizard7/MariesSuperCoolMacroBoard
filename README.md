# CAD

The case was made in Fusion360. The case is three separate parts that are held together with 4 heatset inserts and screws! The PCB is held down with two more screws and heatset inserts. 

## Challenges
This was my first ever hardware project, although I did know some Fusion360 before starting. I came into this with no idea of what KiCad was or hardly any knowledge about hardware however I somehow 
figured things out AKA I watched a bunch of YouTube tutorials. Even with CAD experience, making the case was trickier than I thought it'd be, and I ended up having to remake both the PCB and case a few times. 

## Specifications

+ 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040
+ 9x 1N4148 Diodes

## Notes
This was super fun! Three all nighters later, my project is done. I learned a lot through this process, and this has given me a whole lot of ideas of what to do next.
